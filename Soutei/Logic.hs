  Overall evaluation strategy:

    1. Compile rules starting in parsed form (SynRule) by analyzing the
    patterns of variable use, turning every variable in the head into a
    HeadVar, and in the body to a BodyVar.  Both types contain
      - an offset that is unique to each variable, which will be used to
        assign a run-time variable
      - a description of its use pattern (below)

    2. The run-time approach is essentially the embedding of logic
    programming into a non-determinism monad, as in Seres and Spivey.  To
    translate rules into this embedding, we need to create fresh variable
    names each time a rule is instantiated (so that we don't alias with
    earlier instantiations).  So we keep an integer counter that is
    incremented on each instantiation, and give fresh names to rule
    variables by adding their offsets to the counter.

    We maintain an environment of variable bindings and use unification in
    the usual way.  However, by analyzing variable use patterns (details
    below), we perform some optimizations that minimize the size of the
    environment by avoiding unnecessary bindings.

  The result of compiling an assertion is not represented explicitly; rather
  the technique of run-time-compilation is used to achieve sharing of the
  compiled form.  Most of the *Query functions below are thus written for
  partial application.  The order of arguments is the same order in which
  the information becomes available.  There are basically three times we get
  more information:
    1. Submission of a new assertion.
    2. Start of query. (NB: we don't take advantage of this currently)
    3. Instantiation of a rule.

{-
  The compiled form annotates each variable in the rule, according to how it
  is used.  (The annotations are used in optimizations, described above
  unifyHeadArg.)  Variables we may need to instantiate at run-time are
  numbered with a FrameVar, indicating (uniquely within the rule) their
  offset from the value of the counter when the rule is instantiated.  The
  rest of the annotations are different for variables in the head and in the
  body.

  An example that will clarify the explanation.  The following rule:

    a(?a, ?b, ?c, ?d, ?d) :-
     a(?a, ?b, ?b, ?c),
     a(?c, ?d, ?f, ?f, ?g),
     a(?g, ?e).

  compiles to:

    a(HeadOnly, HeadOnly, HeadOnly, HeadFst 0, HeadDup 3 0) :-
      a(Bound 0 Only, Bound 1 FstAtom 1, Bound 1 Dup 1, Bound 2 Fst 2),
      a(Bound 2 Dup 2, Bound 3 Dup 0, Free FstAtom 3, Free Dup 3, Free Fst 4),
      a(Free Dup 4, Free Only).

  Variables in the head (regardless of their use in the body) are tagged
  with one of the HeadVar constructors:

  - HeadOnly, the variable appears exactly once in the head.
  - HeadFst, the variable appears more than once in the head, and this is
    the first occurrence.
  - HeadDup, the variable appears more than once in the head, and this is
    not the first occurrence.  The BoundVar component refers to the position
    of the first occurrence.

  Variables in the body are either free (not appearing in the head) or bound
  (appearing in the head).  Bound variables have a BoundVar component that
  refers to the position of the first occurrence of that variable in the
  head.  Both free and bound variables (EXCEPT those that occur more than
  once in the head, see below) are tagged with one of the BodyVar
  constructors:

  - Only, the variable appears exactly once in the body.
  - FstAtom, the variable appears more than once in the body, and this is
    the first occurrence, and there is another occurrence in the same atom.
  - Fst, the variable appears more than once in the body, and this is the
    first occurrence, and there is no other occurrence in the same atom.
  - Dup, the variable occurs more than once in the body, or occurs more than
    once in the head (see below).

  As a special case, bound variables that occur more than once in the head
  are always tagged with Dup.

  For the use of these annotations, see unifyHeadArg.

  These types represent Query computations with some information missing.
  As this information is supplied, we partially apply as per run-time
  evaluation.
  - A ClausesQuery takes information about the assertion and produces an

    - The parsed form of the rules.
    - A continuation to instantiate a rule in the same assertion
      (constructed by "tying the knot").
  - An ArgsQuery takes information about the caller and assertion database,
    and produces a FrameQuery.
    - The arguments of the caller, in compiled form.
    - A continuation to instantiate a rule in another assertion.
  - A FrameQuery takes information about the instantiation ("frame") and
    produces a Query.
    - The values of the caller's caller's arguments.
    - The value of the variable counter that the caller was instantiated at.
    TODO: why is the frame not just the caller's arguments as ArgVars??

{-
  In unifyHeadArg and bodyToArg, we make use of the HeadVar and BodyVar
  annotations created during rule compilation to avoid initializing (putting
  into the Query environment) every variable.  Keeping the environment small
  saves memory--we can even run non-terminating queries like "may(?a) :-
  may(?a)." in constant space--and speeds lookup.

  The obvious way to handle variables is to initialize every variable (with
  a fresh name) in the environment when a rule is instantiated.  The
  optimization is that in most cases, variables can be reused.  For example,
  if we have the rule

    a(?x) :- b(?x), c(?x).

  and try to prove a(?z), we can simply use ?z in place of ?x.  Many common
  usages can be optimized in a similar way.  In fact, it is the common cases
  that can most easily optimized.  We don't worry as much about optimizing
  unusual patterns, such as a variable appearing multiply in one atom (head
  or body), which could get more complicated.

  Key to implementation is the ArgVar type.  When a rule is instantiated,
  each of the variables in the caller is represented by an ArgVar,
  indicating 1) what RunVar it corresponds to, and 2) its initialization
  status at the time when it will be unified with the head.  There are four
  cases:
  - ArgInit v, corresponds to RunVar v, which is initialized
  - ArgUninit v, corresponds to RunVar v, which is not yet initialized
  - ArgDoinit v, corresponds to RunVar v, which is not yet initialized, but
    must be initialized during unification with the head
  - ArgUnused, never will be initialized (so does not correspond to any
    RunVar), effectively ignorable

  (Note: ArgDoInit is not strictly necessary; instead the caller could just
  do the initialization itself.  However, it would take extra care to avoid
  initializing before starting the body, which seems wasteful.)

  Here is how unification of a Term ArgVar with the corresponding argument
  in the head (unifyHeadArg) works:
  - If the head argument is a constant, we unify with it:
    - If the Term ArgVar is also a constant, simply compare the two.
    - If the ArgVar is already initialized, this is normal unification.
    - If the ArgVar is not initialized, initialize the RunVar unbound.
    - If the ArgVar is unused, unification succeeds trivially.
  - If the head argument is a variable that appears once in the head, we
    will alias it with the Term ArgVar; ie, subsequent uses of the variable
    will refer back to the caller.  This means we don't need to do any work
    during unification, except to fulfill the DoInit obligation.  In that
    case, we initialize the RunVar unbound.
  - If the head argument is the first of multiple appearances of a variable
    in the head, we must ensure that the ArgVar gets initialized for
    unification at later appearances.
    - If the Term ArgVar is a constant, do nothing.
    - If the ArgVar is not initialized, we initialize the RunVar unbound.
    - If the ArgVar is unused, we initialize a new RunVar using the offset
      of the head variable.
  - If the head argument is a subsequent appearance of a variable, we unify
    with the initialized RunVar (or constant) from the previous case
    (unifyArgArg).  argToRun' looks up the RunVar at which the previous
    ArgVar was initialized (or returns the constant, in that case).
    - If the Term ArgVar is a constant or initialized, unify with the
      previous Term RunVar.
    - If the ArgVar is not initialized, we initialize the RunVar with the
      previous Term RunVar.
    - If the ArgVar is unused, unification succeeds trivially.

  When a rule is instantiated, we must determine the ArgVars in the call to
  the rule in order to proceed with head unification.  To determine the
  ArgVar of a BodyVar argument, we need to refer to the Term ArgVars of the
  caller, and figure out the initialization status of the BodyVar based on
  knowledge of what will have already happened to the variable earlier in
  the head and the body.
  - If the BodyVar is bound, grab the ArgVar of the caller that corresponds
    to the first appearance of the variable in the head.  Recall that
    variables that appear multiply in the head are tagged Dup in the body,
    so except for the Dup case, we can assume that the variable appeared
    exactly once in the head.
    - If the ArgVar was already initialized or DoInit, it is now
      initialized, so becomes Init.
    - If the ArgVar was unused, then we treat the BodyVar as free.
    - If the ArgVar was not initialized, then
      - If it appeared multiply in the head, it will have been initialized
        per the HeadFst case in unification.
      - If it appeared previously in the body, it will have been
        initialized (this plus the previous case cover the Dup tag).
        - If it appeared in a previous atom, it will have been initialized
          (by well-modedness).
        - If it appeared for the first time as an argument in the same atom,
          it will have been initialized by the first appearance.
      - If it is the first appearance, and appears again in the same atom,
        it must be initialized during unification, so that subsequent
        appearances in the same atom can assume it was initialized.  So it
        gets tagged DoInit.
      - Otherwise, the initialization status remains UnInit.
  - If the BodyVar is free (or bound to an unused ArgVar):
    - If it is the only appearance, it can effectively be ignored, so gets
      tagged Unused.
    - If it is the first appearance, and appears again in the same atom, it
      must be initialized during unification, so that subsequent appearances
      in the same atom can assume it was initialized (previous case).  So it
      gets tagged DoInit.
    - If it is the first appearance, and appears again but not in the same
      atom, it gets tagged UnInit.  By well-modedness, it will be
      initialized by the time it is used in later atoms.
    - If it is a subsequent appearance, it will have been initialized, so
      gets tagged Init.
